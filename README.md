# WebMIDI VJ Experiment
A nice little experiment to demonstrate WebMIDI is not just for music.
If you have a MIDI controller surface, you can control 3D visuals with faders and knobs or a velocity sensitive keyboard. 

You can also use [virtual MIDI cables](http://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html) to feed MIDI data into the experiment. 

## Vision
The possibilites with WebMIDI are great. Imagine that you are playing music live from your DAW and by simply placing markers and MIDI events in your sequencer you can control the visualization projected.

Using a MIDI controller, like the [M-Audio Trigger Figer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zw2zV0WMcc) you can control your 3D projects in a better way. You might want to assign the knobs to different parameters in your shader code.
